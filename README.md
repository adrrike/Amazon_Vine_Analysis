## Summary:

- In this sample, yes there would appear to be bias within the reviews for the Vine vs non-Vine program reviews, as vine program 5-star reviews occured at a 12.36% higher rate in the Vine program. 

### Additional analysis: 
- I would analyze other products as the Vine program had a very small sample size, only 94 out of 40,565 total helpful reviews, or .2% of the total dataset.
